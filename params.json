{"name":"Arabic lang classifier","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis project was inspired by the Python [langid module](https://github.com/saffsd/langid.py). This is a generic language classifier that uses the frequency of 3 character sequences as features for a [Naive Bayes classifier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier).\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile.
